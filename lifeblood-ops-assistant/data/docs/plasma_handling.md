# Standard Operating Procedure: Plasma Collection & Handling
**Doc ID:** SOP-PLAS-004  
**Role:** Phlebotomy & Lab  
**Sensitivity:** Internal Use

## 1. Collection Protocols
Plasma is collected via apheresis (separating liquid from cells and returning cells to the donor).

*   **Cycle Limits:** Do not exceed 45 minutes of active machine time without Supervisor approval.
*   **Volume Calculation:** The machine (Trima or Haemonetics) will auto-calculate volume based on donor weight and height (Total Blood Volume).
*   **Anticoagulant:** Citrate is used to prevent clotting. If donor reports "tingling lips," reduce flow rate and offer calcium supplement (Tums).

## 3. Product Storage & Transport
Proper cold chain management is critical for "Fresh Frozen Plasma" (FFP) compliance.

1.  **Labeling:** Apply the ISBT-128 barcode immediately after sealing the bag.
2.  **Freezing Window:** Plasma must be placed in the blast freezer **within 6 hours** of collection start time.
3.  **Target Temperature:**
    *   **Blast Freeze:** -30°C or colder.
    *   **Storage:** Maintain at -18°C or colder for up to 12 months.
4.  **Handling Failures:**
    *   If a unit is left at room temperature for >30 minutes post-collection, flag as "Liquid Plasma" (non-clinical use) and segregate.

## 4. Donor Aftercare (Specific to Plasma)
Plasma donors receive their red cells back, often with saline.

*   **Hydration:** Advise donor to drink 3 glasses of water in the next 3 hours.
*   **Arm Care:** Keep bandage on for 4 hours.
*   **Differential Recovery:** Plasma donors often feel *better* than whole blood donors due to saline return, but "delayed faint" is still a risk.
