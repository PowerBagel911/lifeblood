## 2. IT & Systems Failure
*Procedures for when digital tools (including this Assistant) are unavailable.*

### Scenario A: NextGen Donor Database is Offline
*   **Immediate Action:** Switch to **Paper Forms (Box B under the front desk)**.
*   **Verification:** Call Central Registry (Ext 5500) to verify donor eligibility verbally before bleeding.
*   **Data Entry:** All paper forms must be keyed into NextGen within 24 hours of system restoration.

### Scenario B: Label Printer Failure
*   **Impact:** Cannot label blood bags safely.
*   **Action:** **Stop all collections** immediately. Unlabeled bags are biological waste and cannot be processed.
*   **Escalation:** Log ticket with IT Service Desk (Priority 1). Inform waiting donors of cancellation.

## 3. Ambiguous Eligibility
If a donor's situation is not covered by standard Guidelines:
1.  Check the **"Clinical Support App"** (or this Assistant).
2.  If no clear answer, call the **Clinical Call Center (1300-CLINICAL)**.
3.  **Rule of Thumb:** *If in doubt, defer for safety.* Never guess on eligibility.
