## 1. Core Demographic Requirements
All donors must meet the basic safety threshold before screening proceeds.

*   **Age:**
    *   **First-time donors:** Must be aged between **18 and 75** years inclusive.
    *   **Existing donors:** Can continue donating until age 81, provided they have donated successfully within the last 5 years.
*   **Weight:**
    *   Minimum weight is **50kg** for all donation types (Whole Blood, Plasma, Platelets).
    *   Underweight donors are at higher risk of vasovagal reactions (fainting) and must be deferred.

## 2. Health & Medical Deferrals
Staff must verify the following during the private interview stage:

*   **Cold & Flu:** Donors must be symptom-free for at least 7 days. If they have a fever (>37.6°C) on arrival, defer for 14 days.
*   **Antibiotics:**
    *   **Acne medication (preventative):** Eligible immediately.
    *   **Infection treatment:** Defer for 1 week *after* the course is finished and the donor is fully recovered.
*   **Dental Work:**
    *   **Cleaning/Check-up:** Eligible after 24 hours.
    *   **Extraction/Root Canal:** Defer for 7 days to reduce bacteremia risk.

## 3. Travel & Lifestyle Restrictions
*   **Tattoos & Piercings:**
    *   **Licensed Australian Premise:** Eligible immediately (if site is healed).
    *   **Unlicensed/Overseas:** Defer for 4 months from the date of procedure.
*   **Malaria Risk Zones:**
    *   Donors who have visited declared malaria zones (e.g., parts of SE Asia, Africa) must wait **4 months** before donating Whole Blood.
    *   *Exception:* They may be eligible to donate **Plasma** immediately as the filtration process removes malaria risk (check Plasma Eligibility Map).

## 4. Frequently Asked Questions (Staff Scripting)
> **"I had a beer at lunch, can I donate?"**
> *No. Donors must not be under the influence of alcohol. If they have consumed alcohol on the day of donation, defer to next day to ensure hydration levels are safe.*

> **"I'm pregnant, can I donate?"**
> *No. Defer for the duration of pregnancy and for 9 months after giving birth to allow iron stores to recover.*
